    In this game you must take the sheep to the top of the hill.<br>
    The problem is that in this game you are not really cool, so only some sheep will follow you.<br>
    <font color="grey">Grey</font> sheep are not cool either, so as soon as you press spacebar they will start to follow.<br>
    <font color="yellow">Golden</font> sheep are kinda cool, so they won't even look at you. But if you are followed by two or more sheep they will change their mind.<br>
    <font color="red">C</font><font color="yellow">o</font><font color="blue">o</font><font color="green">l</font> sheep are cool. They will only hang out with you if you hang out with cool people.
